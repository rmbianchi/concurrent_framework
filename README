About:
======

This project provides a concurrent whiteboard and a few implementations of parallel algorithm/module scheduling for HEP on top of Intel's TBB:

 1) dependency_graph.cpp uses tbb::flow::graph. A few additions to TBB were necessary
 2) taskgraph_example.cpp uses tbb:task directly and uses N copies of the algorithm dependency DAG to handle N events in parallel
 3) taskbits_example.cpp uses tbb:task directly and uses each one bit per algorithm to descripe the state of the event. 
 
The implementations 2) and 3) provide a feature to deal with limited resources/ non-reentrant algorithms.
